# MVC
To develop a tech blog, this software makes use of numerous files, database storage, and technologies. On the front page, users can see any blogs and click them to access the comments. It will be clear who posted both the post and the comments.

A user can sign up to make an account or connect in to an existing one if they want to build their own blog. Once they have logged in, they can access a dashboard where they can post blogs. Additionally, they can visit other blogs and post comments there, providing their name and the date.


The user can then log out to end their session, or a timeout is available.
